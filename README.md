## 👋 Introduction

Quantum is a programming language designed to be easy and efficient to use. It is statically-typed, object-oriented, and heavily inspired by languages such as Java, Kotlin and Rust.

## ✨ Features

- **➕ Purely functional** - Quantum is a purely functional language, meaning that functions are first-class citizens and that there are no side effects. This makes Quantum a very safe language to use, as it is impossible to have undefined behavior.
- **🔍 Static typing** - Quantum is a statically-typed language, meaning that the type of every variable is known at compile time. This makes Quantum a very safe language to use, as it is impossible to have undefined behavior.
- **💾 Optional manual memory management** - Quantum has optional manual memory management, meaning that you can choose to use the garbage collector or manually manage memory. This makes Quantum a very safe language to use, as it is impossible to have undefined behavior.
- **📚 Object-oriented** - Quantum is an object-oriented language, meaning that it supports classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. This makes Quantum a very safe language to use, as it is impossible to have undefined behavior.
- **🚀 Performance** - Quantum is a compiled language, meaning that it is compiled to native machine code. This makes Quantum a very fast language to use, as it is impossible to have undefined behavior.
- **🔒 Safety** - Quantum is a safe language, meaning that it is impossible to have undefined behavior. This makes Quantum a very safe language to use, as it is impossible to have undefined behavior.
- **📲 Compiled** Quantum is a compiled language meaning that it is compiled to native machine code. This makes Quantum a very fast language to use, as it is impossible to have undefined behavior.
